They are used for assessing a new purchase or refinancing existing commercial and industrial buildings. Our reports are also used for General Assessments for building owners at budget time and for insurance purposes. \nBC Roof Inspections’ reports are used by property management companies, real estate development firms, retirement funds, restaurants, hospitals, school districts, city, county, and provincial and federal agencies just to name a few. \nThe data that is compiled during our field inspections are presented in an organized way (see Roof Management Page) which explains each roof item in detail. The information in the roof inspection report includes the existing condition(s) of the roof and components, the estimated remaining life of the existing roof(s), and provides budget numbers for corrective action (ongoing maintenance, repairs, and replacement estimates). Our reports also include photo documentation. \nWe also specialize in deck membrane inspections and sundeck, parkade, and courtyard waterproofing inspections.",

When generating a claim for the plaintiff's counsel or advising the defence counsel, our input comes without bias towards a particular party. Our advice is based on historical performance issues and construction defects. \nWe have an extensive track record of amicably resolving roof and envelope disputes while limiting the duration of mediation or costly trials. We believe that a fair representation of the facts at the forefront of a dispute brings the parties closer to an agreement on corrective actions and costs. Our opinions are based on prevailing codes in force during design, industry standards, approvals, datasheets, historical project documentation reviews where applicable, and current and past building codes. \nConcise and comprehensive reports or analyses can be provided and are arranged and presented appropriately for the uniqueness of each project (as one report style does not suit all cases). \nExpert testimony services are provided when needed, and our experts carry appropriate credentials required by the Roofing Contractors Association of British Columbia (RCABC) and RCI, Incorporated, as well as meaningful real-world experience."

            "description": "Do you have a roof leak that needs investigating? \nSome roof leak sources are obvious surface deficiencies. Some roof leaks are just pesky little drips that annoy you. Some roof leaks can be tricky to locate. But even the pesky little drips can evolve into much bigger problems if not addressed as soon as identified. Roof leaks come in all shapes and sizes, so locating and properly addressing roof leaks is important and something we do efficiently. \n When is a roof leak not a roof leak? \nWhen the leak is from rooftop equipment, such as drain problems and other parts on the roof (vents, skylights). We make sure we thoroughly inspect the area of the water infiltration inside the building or home, and then investigate the rooftop area where the water is penetrating the interior of the unit. We make a detailed report indicating the problem and the solution and email it to you or your roofing contractor. \nOur roof leak services are just one quick phone call away. We know what types of things to look for when it comes to a leaking roof. It’s true, sometimes a roof leak can be rectified in a few minutes, and some roof leaks require more than just a ‘quick fix.’ Depending on the severity of the leak and its location, BC Roof Inspections can provide details on how your roofing contractor can solve the problem to eliminate the roof leak."

            "description": "What is “Roof Maintenance”? \nRoof Maintenance is the performing of routine tasks necessary to keep a roof in a watertight condition. Performing roof maintenance protects the durability of the roof. \nA consistent and routine maintenance plan is critical to the long-term performance of your roof system. BC Roof Inspections provides a recommended roof maintenance program and annual inspections to protect the longevity of your roof. \nLike everything else in our lives, roofs get older. They go through the wear and tear of natural aging and exposure to the elements. That’s where we come in; we know if maintenance services are not completed on your roof(s) regularly, the service life of your roof will be greatly reduced. You could even void the warranty of that new roof. We know the average life of a built-up roof is 18-20 years and that the average life of a single-ply roof system is 15-20 years. And it’s a fact the service life of a roof will increase if the roofs are properly maintained. You’d be surprised how many times re-roofing is routinely performed when it isn’t required!"
